# Homework 2: Loops and Functions

## Starter Files
Download [hw02.zip](https://github.com/david-yan/CS110_starter_code/blob/master/hw02.zip?raw=true). Inside the archive,
you will find starter files for the questions in this homework, along with a copy of the [Ok](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab01/ok)
autograder.

## Running Tests
To test that your code is working correctly, run `python3 ok`. This will automatically run the test suite against your code.
Please make sure to check your output to ensure that all of the tests passed. If you have any problems running the tester,
please make a post on Piazza.

## Using OK
For ease of testing for both you and the grader, we will now be using a program called Ok for testing homeworks, labs, and
projects. A few important things to note about using Ok are the following:

To run all of the tests using Ok, run the following:
```
python3 ok
```

To run a test for a specified function, run the following command:
```
python3 ok -q <specified function>
```

By default, only tests that did not pass will show up. You can use the `-v` option to show all the tests, including tests
you have passed.
```
python3 ok -v
```

## Submitting
To submit, please go to [okpy](https://okpy.org/usf/cs110/sp20/hw02/) (you will need to log in with your usfca.edu email),
and click `Create a new submission`. The instructions will direct you on how you should submit the assignment. You can create
multiple submissions, and for grading, you most recent submission will be used.

The submissions will always be open up to 3 days after the assigned due date to account for slip days. If you want to create
a submission after the deadline to get comments, but do not want to use slip days, please indicate clearly in your submission.

## Questions

### Q1: Reverse String
Reverse a string without using the builtin `reversed` function in Python.
```
def reverse(string):
    """ Reverse a string without using the reversed string function.

    >>> reverse('abc')
    'cba'
    >>> reverse('a')
    'a'
    >>> reverse('')
    ''
    """
    output = ""
    for ____:
        output += ____
    return output
```
Using Ok, test your code with:
```
python3 ok -q reverse
```

### Q2: Palindrome
Using the `reverse` function from Q1, return True if a string is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome),
and False otherwise.
```
def palindrome(string):
    """ Returns True if string is a palindrome.
        * Hint: Use the reverse function you wrote above.

    >>> palindrome('aba')
    True
    >>> palindrome('detartrated')
    True
    >>> palindrome('abc')
    False
    >>> palindrome('')
    True
    """
    return ____ == ____
```
Using Ok, test your code with:
```
python3 ok -q palindrome
```

### Q3: Every Other
Given a list, `lst`, and a number, `n`, return the result of combining every `n`th element of `lst`, starting with the
first element. 
```
def every_other(lst, n):
    """ Returns the result of combining every nth item of lst.

    >>> every_other([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)
    [1, 3, 5]
    >>> every_other([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
    [1, 3, 5]
    >>> every_other([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3)
    [1, 4, 7, 10]
    """
    output = []
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    return output
```
Using Ok, test your code with:
```
python3 ok -q every_other
```
