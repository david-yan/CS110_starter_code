# Homework 1: Input, Data Types, Control Statements

## Starter Files
Download [hw01.zip](https://github.com/david-yan/CS110_starter_code/blob/master/hw01.zip?raw=true). Inside the archive,
you will find starter files for the questions in this homework, along with a copy of the [Ok](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab01/ok)
autograder.

## Running Tests
To test that your code is working correctly, run `python3 ok`. This will automatically run the test suite against your code.
Please make sure to check your output to ensure that all of the tests passed. If you have any problems running the tester,
please make a post on Piazza.

## Using OK
For ease of testing for both you and the grader, we will now be using a program called Ok for testing homeworks, labs, and
projects. A few important things to note about using Ok are the following:

To run all of the tests using Ok, run the following:
```
python3 ok
```

To run a test for a specified function, run the following command:
```
python3 ok -q <specified function>
```

By default, only tests that did not pass will show up. You can use the `-v` option to show all the tests, including tests
you have passed.
```
python3 ok -v
```

## Submitting
To submit, please go to [okpy](https://okpy.org/usf/cs110/sp20/hw01/) (you will need to log in with your usfca.edu email),
and click `Create a new submission`. The instructions will direct you on how you should submit the assignment. You can create
multiple submissions, and for grading, you most recent submission will be used.

The submissions will always be open up to 3 days after the assigned due date to account for slip days. If you want to create
a submission after the deadline to get comments, but do not want to use slip days, please indicate clearly in your submission.

## Questions

### Q1: Review Week 1
Let's begin by applying all of the concepts that we learned in the first week of class. Ask the user for an integer using
the `input` command, and return True if the integer is positive, False otherwise. For this question, we will consider zero
to be a positive integer.
```
def positive():
    """Ask if for an integer via the `input` command.
       Return True if the integer is positive, False otherwise.

    Example test cases:
    % python hw01_review.py
    Enter integer: 1
    True
    % python hw01_review.py
    Enter integer: -1
    False
    % python hw01_review.py
    Enter integer: 0
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
Unfortunately there are no automatic tests for this question, so please test manually with:
```
python3 hw01_review.py
```

### Q2: Review: What Would Python Display?
Review and test your knowledge of `input` and data types by completing the following questions:
```
python3 ok -q review -u
```

### Coding Practice

### Q3: Both Positives
Using if statements, fill in the following conditions to display True if both `a` and `b` are positive (zero is positve).
```
def both_positives(a, b):
    """Returns True if both a and b are positive.

    >>> both_positives(-1, 1)
    False
    >>> both_positives(1, 1)
    True
    >>> both_positives(0, 1)
    True
    """
    if ____:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
Using Ok, test your code with:
```
python3 ok -q both_positives
```

### Q4: Get Item
Let's make sure we understand lists and indexes. Given a list, `lst`, and a number, `n`, return the `n`th element of `lst`.
Please look at the tests if you are confused.
```
def get_item(lst, n):
    """ Returns the nth element of the lst, or None if the element doesn't exist.

    >>> get_item([17, 73, 35, 97], 1)
    17
    >>> get_item('uniqlo', 4)
    'q'
    >>> get_item([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
    >>> get_item([1, 2, 3, 4], -1)
    """
    if ___ or ___: # <--- Change here.
        return None
    output = ___ # <--- Change here.
    return output
```
Using Ok, test your code with:
```
python3 ok -q get_item
```

### Q5: If Function
Let's replicate an if statement with a little more functionality. 
```
def if_function(condition, true_result, false_result):
    """Return true_result if condition is a true value, and false_result otherwise.

    >>> if_function(True, 2, 3)
    2
    >>> if_function(False, 2, 3)
    3
    >>> if_function(3==2, 3+2, 3-2)
    1
    >>> if_function(3>2, 3+2, 3-2)
    5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
Using Ok, test your code with:
```
python3 ok -q if_function
```
